# Python-Chatbot
An Artificial Intelligence Chatbot using Python with AIML and various Python libraries. 
The chatbot gives personalised recommendations for shoes. 
It is still in development will be adding image classification and several other features in the future development. 

**What is in the chatbot?**
* A web interface using Flask.
* Rule based component where the chatbot is asked questions from the AIML file and gives correct responses. 
* Similarity-based component where the chatbot is asked questions but with just keywords and it gives the correct responses. 
* Image Classification component where a CNN model is implemented to chatbot and the chatbot can detect the image it is given. With the use of Keras and Tensorflow. To analyse the image and give response. 
* Toy world reasoning, using NLTK library and grammer file. A more smarter approach then rule based.
* Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI
* Sequence to Sequence Model, that translates phrases given to chatbot.
